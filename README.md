# Trace of the category of divisibility posets

This repository contains the output of a python script used to compute the trace of the category $\mathcal{D}_m$ consisting of the divisibility posets $D_n=(\{1,\ldots,n\},\mid)$ for $n\leq m$. See [MO 482041](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/482041) for more details.

The equivalence classes in $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathcal{D}_m)$ are given in the files 01.txt, 02.txt, etc.
